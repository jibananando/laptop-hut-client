                    What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?

                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:<br />
                        1. Local state.<br />
                        2. Global state.<br />
                        3. Server state.<br />
                        3. URL state.</p>

                    How does prototypical inheritance work?
                </div>
                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>Prototypical inheritance allows us to reuse the properties or methods from one JavaScript object to another through a reference pointer function. All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype: Date objects inherit from Date.</p>

                    What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
                </div>
                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The isolated part of the definition is important.
                        For Test-Driven Development (TDD), you write unit tests before writing any implementation. This makes your implementation details in your code shorter and easier to understand. In this instance, the best time to write unit tests is immediately. For others, most developers write unit tests after the code's been written

                    React vs. Angular vs. Vue?
                </div>
                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>Vue provides higher customizability and hence is easier to learn than Angular or React. Further, Vue has an overlap with Angular and React with respect to their functionality like the use of components. Hence, the transition to Vue from either of the two is an easy option.</p>
